Domain-Cycling: An Exploration into Unpaired Image-To-Image Domain Mapping

Significant prior research has been done in the image-processing field of “style-transfer.”  Most popularly, style-transfer has been utilized to transform the style in which various pieces of artwork are drawn into a completely different style by that of a different author.  This phenomenon can be extended to the act of isolating key objects in images and videos and transforming such objects from their original domain-style to an entirely new domain (ex. zebras transformed into horses).  We seek to generalize this approach and utilize Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks to perform unpaired image-to-image domain mapping.  

This project was completed for the course ECE 588 at Duke University (Fall 2022).
